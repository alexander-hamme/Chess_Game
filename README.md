# chess_game
Wrote a minimally functional chess game from scratch out of personal interest. An eventual goal is to make a better chess AI than the regular solutions of using simple search algorithms (such as Minimax with aggressive pruning) that search the entire game state space can achieve. To do this, I'll most likely use reinforcement learning.
