# chess_game
Wrote a minimally functional chess game from scratch out of personal interest. At some point I may try to make a better chess AI than the regular solutions of using simple search algorithms (such as Minimax with aggressive pruning) that search the entire game state space of moves. To do this, I'd most likely use reinforcement learning.
