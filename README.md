# chess_game
Wrote a minimally functional chess game from scratch out of personal interest. At some point I may try to make a better (more efficient) chess AI than the regular ~simple~ solutions like using the Minimax search algorithm with aggressive pruning. To do this, I'd most likely use reinforcement learning.
