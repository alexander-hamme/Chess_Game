Writing a chess engine from scratch simply out of personal interest. An eventual goal is to make a better chess AI than the regular solutions of using simple search algorithms (such as Minimax with aggressive pruning) to search the game state space can achieve. To do this, I'll most likely use reinforcement learning.
